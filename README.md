# urbit-go-frontend

The front-end repository for [urbit-go](https://github.com/Vrend/urbit-go)

Here you can find the source files for the front-end, for development purposes. If you're just trying to use the app, the build files will be in the original repository under the glob directory.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
